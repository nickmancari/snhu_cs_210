## Summary:

Create a banking app that lets you show the progress of interest over a given time period.

## What did you do particularly well?

The UI that I created with the menu was designed really well, in my opinion.

## Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

Containing the code a little better in a Class-based structure would have increased the maintainability.

## Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

Handling the output of the calculations was difficult at times. It took me a few tries to get it right.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Learning C++ in general was a useful skill. It's a langauge that really challenges you to think and plan.

## How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Splitting things up in separate functions kept the code easy to read and better to maintain.
